# Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data

## Objective
To apply statistical analysis techniques to experimental-style data
and understand noise behaviour and uncertainty.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of simulated experimental measurements
with inherent noise.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Performed
- Noise distribution analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence interval estimation

## Key Insights
- Identified statistical characteristics of measurement noise
- Evaluated uncertainty in experimental observations

## Relevance
This project bridges experimental physics concepts
with data science and statistical analysis techniques.
